   "source": [
    "Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Granular control**: Logging provides different levels of severity (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing you to control which messages are displayed or recorded based on their importance. With print(), you have limited control over the level of detail in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configurability**: Logging allows you to configure various aspects, such as output format, log destination (e.g., console, file), and log rotation. You can easily switch between different configurations without modifying your code. Print() statements, on the other hand, require manual modification to control the output behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Runtime enable/disable**: You can enable or disable logging messages dynamically during runtime without modifying the code. This is especially useful for troubleshooting or adjusting the verbosity of your program. With print(), you would need to manually comment out or remove the print() statements to disable them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integration with libraries**: Many libraries and frameworks use the logging module, allowing you to integrate your own logging with their logging systems. This ensures consistency in logging practices across different components of your software.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Logging hierarchy**: The logging module supports hierarchical logging, where you can define loggers for different parts of your application. This allows you to organize and categorize log messages based on their origin, making it easier to trace and debug issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Performance impact**: Logging can be more efficient than print() in terms of performance, especially when you have extensive logging throughout your codebase. Logging allows you to control the level of detail and selectively enable or disable logging messages, reducing unnecessary output and improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, using the logging module provides more flexibility, configurability, and control over your program's logging behavior compared to using print() statements. It enhances the maintainability, readability, and extensibility of your code, particularly in larger and more complex software projects."
