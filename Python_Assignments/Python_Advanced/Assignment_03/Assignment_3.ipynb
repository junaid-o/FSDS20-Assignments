    "The concept of an abstract superclass, also known as an abstract base class (ABC), is a feature in Python that allows you to define a common interface or structure for a group of related classes. An abstract superclass cannot be instantiated directly; instead, it serves as a blueprint for its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, abstract superclasses are created using the `abc` module, which stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" This module provides the `ABC` class and the `abstractmethod` decorator, which are used to define abstract methods and abstract superclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass typically defines one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. These abstract methods provide a common interface that ensures consistency and adherence to a specific contract among the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating an abstract superclass, you can define common behavior and requirements for a group of related classes while allowing flexibility for individual implementations. Subclasses of the abstract superclass are required to implement the abstract methods defined in the superclass, ensuring that they conform to the expected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of an abstract superclass promotes code reusability, modularity, and enforceability of contracts in object-oriented programming. It allows you to create a hierarchy of related classes with a well-defined structure, promoting consistency and maintainability in your codebase."

    "A class needs to manually call a superclass's `__init__` method when it overrides the `__init__` method in the subclass and wants to include the initialization logic from the superclass as well. This allows the subclass to inherit and utilize the initialization code defined in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when a class inherits from a superclass (also known as a parent class or base class), it does not automatically invoke the superclass's `__init__` method unless explicitly called. This behavior allows the subclass to have its own custom initialization logic while still benefiting from the initialization logic defined in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "By explicitly calling the superclass's `__init__` method within the subclass's `__init__` method, the subclass can ensure that the superclass's initialization code is executed before its own custom initialization code. This way, the subclass can initialize any attributes or perform any setup steps defined in the superclass, in addition to its own specific initialization tasks.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `Superclass` defines an `__init__` method that initializes the `value` attribute. The `Subclass` inherits from `Superclass` and overrides its `__init__` method. However, before performing its own initialization, the `Subclass` calls the superclass's `__init__` method using `super().__init__(value)`. This ensures that the superclass's initialization logic is executed first, setting the `value` attribute. Then, the subclass continues with its own initialization, setting the `extra` attribute.\n",
