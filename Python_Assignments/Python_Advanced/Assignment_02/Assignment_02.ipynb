    "In Python, classes and modules are both key components of object-oriented programming and code organization. While they have distinct purposes, there is a relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python code that can define functions, variables, and classes. It serves as a container for related code and provides a way to organize and reuse code across multiple files. Modules allow you to break down your program into smaller, more manageable units and provide namespaces to avoid naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects of a specific type. Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data, providing a way to create multiple instances (objects) with shared behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between classes and modules is that classes can be defined within a module. A module can contain one or more class definitions along with other code. By defining classes in a module, you can organize related classes together and reuse them in other modules or scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import a module into another module or script, you can access the classes defined in that module using dot notation, like `module_name.ClassName`. This allows you to use the classes and their associated attributes and methods from the imported module.\n",

    "In Python, you can create instances (objects) and classes using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a Class:\n",
    "   To create a class, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyClass:\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Creating Instances (Objects):\n",
    "   To create an instance of a class, you call the class name followed by parentheses, similar to calling a function. This invokes the class constructor and returns a new instance. You can assign this instance to a variable for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Initializing Objects with the `__init__` Method:\n",
    "   In many cases, you'll want to initialize the objects with some initial state or values. You can define a special method called `__init__` (init method) within the class, which is automatically called when an object is created. It allows you to set initial attributes and perform any necessary setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyClass:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "           self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_object = MyClass(\"Alice\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the above example, the `__init__` method takes a `name` parameter and assigns it to the `name` attribute of the instance. The `my_object` instance is created with the name \"Alice\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Accessing Attributes and Methods:\n",
    "   Once you have an instance of a class, you can access its attributes and methods using dot notation. Attributes hold data associated with the instance, while methods are functions defined within the class that can operate on the instance or perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyClass:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
